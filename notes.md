There's two versions of this plugin. The simple one is called: Markdown Image Downloader. The more complicated one is called Markdown Suite. Markdown Suite is the one that I'm working on. Moving forward. I need to write a complete README for how to set up the development environment for this plugin. Well, actually for both of them. This needs to include dependency installs. When to compile? How to debug? And let's try and include the skeleton setup PowerShell script.

## Markdown Suite

This version of the plugin uses a modular architecture in that we can make a plugin and then add that to the plugin directory within the extension. This way we can constantly add more functionality to the suite. This method would also allow other users to add to the markdown suite in a very easy way. This is the main reason why I'm moving forward with this version of the plugin.

## Markdown Image Downloader

This this version of the plugin. It was really just a proof of concept. It works, but it is being deprecated for Markdown Suite.
